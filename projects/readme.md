# Final Project Guidelines

## 1\. Requirement

Regarding the final project, you are expected to work individually or in pair to make a useful web map. The final project can be simple and focused in nature, but must include:

- One or more **basemap** to give geographic context;
- One or more **thematic layers** that are separate from the basemap (e.g., Choropleth map, Heatmap, and etc.); and 
- One or more **interactive elements** that reveal more information (e.g., click a feature to trigger pop-up window, hover to change the style of a feature).

From the cartographic perspective, you should also consider to include several map elements, such as a legend, a scale bar, a map title, a paragraph of description, credit information, a north arrow and/or an overview map.

In creating your final project, you should use at least one web mapping technique that was **NOT** covered in the course materials, but may be introduced in the reading list. This could, for instance, be a leaflet (or cesium) class, method,or a plugin. You don't have to specify this part when you make the proposal, but as you work through the different exercises in the course you should stay aware of additional functions you could incorporate to meet this requirement.

It is fine to show your web map application in a local web environment (built by python simple http server or Webstorm), but I encourage you deploy your web map to a dedicated course server [http://www.mapio.us](http://www.mapio.us) or your Google cloud Server.

## 2\. Submission

There are three parts to the term project submission:

1. A **cover letter** that lists the key information of the submission
   - Name, email, and ONID;
   - A list of items in your submission package; and 
   - Other information you consider to be necessary.
2. A **project report** that includes,
   - An introduction to your final project (3 pages and double spaced). You might describe the project purpose, data source, map elements,  map libraries, and other issues you think are necessary to inform your audience of;
   - The decision process you went through when deciding how to serve the different layers;
   - A functionality summary of the web mapping. You are required to explain each function using **a screenshot of  the map and a concomitant brief description**. This summary could be something similar to a walkthrough handout I demonstrated in lecture. 
   - The things you learned in this project that will be most valuable to you in your professional or academic career.
3. **Source code** that contains all the files (html, js, css, and data) used to make the web mapping application.

Please compress the cover letter, project report, and the source code in a zipped package, and submit it to a dropbox in Canvas **(by 5:00pm on March 19th)**. 

## 3\. Presentation and peer review

Academics often attend conferences where they share their discoveries and browse the work of others to gain new ideas and offer feedback. on March 22nd, we will hold a final presentation meeting at 361 Strand Hall. Each team (made up of an individual or pair) is asked to present their final project in 8 minutes. And there will be a F&A session in 2 to 3 minutes.  During the final presentation, each student will need to review all final projects and submit your review notes.

## 4\. Bonus

The final project has a bonus session to encourage you to understand and further contribute to the open source community. If you complete **all the three tasks** listed below, you will earn the bonus credits:

1.  Publish your web map in an Internet accessible server. This server could be your google cloud platform, the course map server at `http://www.mapio.us`, or others.
2.  Share your source code on GitHub.
3.  Convert your project report into a **README.md** file and share to the front page of your GitHub repository.

## 5\. Timeline

1. **Submit your project proposal by 5:00pm on Feb 10th**. The proposal should at least contain the project topic, potential audience, and the possible data sources.
2. Each project team will hold a project meeting with the instructor Bo Zhao to detail the proposal during the week Feb 13th to 17th.
3. The instructor and the TA will help each team look for data, map libraries and fine-tune the web map interface design. Each team will have one month to work on the final project.
4. Please compress the cover letter, project report, and the source code in a zipped package, and submit it to a dropbox in Canvas **by 5:00pm on March 19th.** (if you want to get the bonus credit, you will need to complete the requirements for the bonus by this deadline as well.)
5. **On March 22th (Wednesday) 12:00pm to 1:50pm**, we will hold a final project presentation meeting at 361 strand hall.
6. You will need to submit **peer review notes** for each project right after the presentation meeting. 

>  **Note:** The requirements to the final project may be slightly changed according the progress of this course. The final requirements are subject to the instructor's notification.
