Welcome to the lab session of GEOG 371: Web Mapping. As the first lab of this course, we will introduce the Digital Earth Lab at Wilkinson 210, download the course material and more importantly, help you be familiar with the major steps of managing a web mapping project. To do that, you will start with registering a github account, and learn how to use several software products, such as Webstorm, Typora, and Git. To test the learning objectives, we will ask you to publish your resume on github. Okay, let us kick off this lab! 

# 1. Preprations

## 1.1 Digital Earth Lab @ Oregon State University

Digital Earth Lab is a teaching facility primarily for GIS, remote sensing, cartography, numerical analysis, and scientific visualization. The classroom is a facility of the OSU College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science and is supported by the OSU Media Services. The lab was originally funded by a NASA infrastructure grant to Sherm Bloomer (professor & Dean, College of Science) and Nick Pisias (professor & former associate dean of COAS). Digital Earth is located in 210 Wilkinson Hall and is one of the most advanced teaching facilities on the Oregon State campus. We have been operational since the beginning of Spring term, 1999.

The lab generally opens 8am-5pm , a detailed schedule can be found at [http://dusk.geo.orst.edu/de/de_teach.html](http://dusk.geo.orst.edu/de/de_teach.html). The manager of the facility is Cory Langhoff. If you need afterhours access, contact Cory Langhoff [langhofc@oregonstate.edu](mailto:langhofc@oregonstate.edu), or dial 7-2532 to make arrangements. Please ahead of time.

## 1.2 Software Setup

For this lab, you will need to install the following software:

- **Webstorm:** A professional web mapping programming development environment ([Click here for the installation instruction](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/buy/#edition=discounts)). and make sure you install the edition **for students and teachers**). Once you installed it, you will need to register it, usually the registration need to be renewed on an anual basis; 


- **Typora:** An editor for composing Markdown files ([Click here to download Typora](https://typora.io/)); and
- **Git:** A version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people ([Click here to download, choose the right platform, and then install](https://git-scm.com/downloads)). 

If **Git** is successfully installed, type `git` in command prompt (if you are a window user) or terminal (if you are a mac or linux user), the following screen will be shown up.

Once you have `git`  up and running,  you can sync the course material and also publish your own project repository.  We will talk about that in details in the following sections of this lab.

### 1.3 Register a Github account

1\. You will apply for a Github account for managing and sychronizing your web mapping project. If you do not have a Github account yet, please sign up at [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com)

> **Do you know the differences between Git and Github?**
>
> **Git** is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any files. Git was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
>
>  **GitHub** is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. GitHub offers both plans for private and free repositories on the same account which are commonly used to host open-source software projects. As of April 2016, GitHub reports having more than 14 million users and more than 35 million repositories, making it the largest host of source code in the world.
